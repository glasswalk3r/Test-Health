=head1 NAME

Test::Health - Perl API to process tests and send an e-mail report in case of failures

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is only Pod.

See the Pod of health_check.pl script for details of usage.

For information regarding extending this distribution, check the other Pods available.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test-Health is a Perl distribution created to implement a "poor's man" health check API.

By using standard test modules like Test-Simple, you can implement your tests and use Test-Health
to run those tests, collect results and send an e-mail in the case any test fails.

This is usefull if you want to implement a simple health check on your system, but don't have a monitoring system
like Nagios (or doesn't want to use one). Once you have the test files, it is pretty straighforward to send an e-mail
in case of problems.

Be sure to check the Pod documentation include in this distribution for more details.
